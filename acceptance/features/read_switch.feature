Feature: Read switch information
  As a webui
  I want to read information about the switch
  In order to show it to the user

Scenario Outline: read state of switch
  Given the switch is <switch>

  When I request data

  Then I expect the following line in the http response:
    """
    <switch state="<switch>"/>
    """

  Examples:

    |     on |
    |    off |
